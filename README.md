# Wedding Seating Chart

A pretty cool, Material Design, app that I created for the seating chart at my wedding. Has nice animations, nice style, and it works really well.

It is designed for tablets, things are a bit squished on phones, but it works alright.

This app could very easily be adapted to host the seating chart for any events. Just set out a few tablets and you are ready to go. Check out the [Guest Generator Readme](/guest_generator/README.md) to find out how to import your own guest list instead of using my example one.
